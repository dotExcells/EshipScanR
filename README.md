# EshipScanR v2.5.0 - 15/10/2025 "Open Release"

This processing code is only compatible with data produced by the [Entrepreneurship Competency Scan](https://edu.nl/mqmny)

MS Forms is constantly adding extra columns to the .xls output of a form, so the program may need to be adjusted from time to time to remove them.

## Usage
0.	Download the .xls file containing the Eship scan data to a folder of your choice, ensure it is the **ONLY** .xls file in that folder

1. 	Copy the file "process.R" to the folder containing your data

2.	Open "process.R" in RStudio

3.	Click in the section containing the code and press Ctrl+A to select all

4.	Press Ctrl+Enter to run the code

5.	You should now see a folder called "Charts d-m-y H M" in your original folder

6.	Cross reference the first and last chart with your original data to double check
