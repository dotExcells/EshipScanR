# Entrepreneurial Competency Scan – For use with EshipScanR

The following is a guide to replicating the structure of the entrepreneurial competence survey.

## Auto-generated fields

Assuming Microsoft have not changed the default form structure, MS Forms will create the following columns in the Excel output:
ID
Start time
Completion time
Email
Name	
Last modified time

You do not need to manually create these fields and they will not be visible to the participants.
ID will be automatically filled in; the rest will not be filled in.

The data analysis programme begins by removing columns two to six. Therefore, successful analysis depends on there being five auto-generated fields before the collected data. To verify this easily, the last column in the Excel file should be “AH”. If there are more or fewer than five columns at the start, the processing code should be adjusted.

## Unique code

Participants should be instructed to create a unique identifier that they will be able to remember. This will allow the result files to be shared easily with a class without every participant knowing the others’ results.

An example method of generating a unique code is:

> We would like you to make an unique code to identify yourself.
> By making this unique code your answers can be analysed in an anonymous way.
> 
> This code has to exist of the first letter of your name, followed by your date of birth and concluded with the first letter of your place of birth.
>  
> An example:
> 
> Name: Linda
> Date of birth: 29-07-1991
> Place of birth: Amsterdam
>  
> The unique code in this case is: L29071991A (this is just an example, do not copy this code!)
